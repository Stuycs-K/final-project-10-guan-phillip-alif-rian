# Alif in the Phillipines
## Group Info
By: Rian Alif and Phillip Guan
## Overview
The objective of this project is to understand and implement the Hill cipher, a classical encryption algorithm that uses linear algebra to encrypt and decrypt messages. This involves creating a functional encryption and decryption tool based on the Hill cipher, demonstrating its principles. Along with just demonstrating the Hill Cipher, we also implemented some of the things we learned with image manipulation and incorporated that into our project too.
