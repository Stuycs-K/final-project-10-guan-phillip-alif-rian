By: Rian Alif and Phillip Guan
## Overview
The objective of this project is to understand and implement the Hill cipher, a classical encryption algorithm that uses linear algebra to encrypt and decrypt messages. This involves creating a functional encryption and decryption tool based on the Hill cipher, demonstrating its principles. Along with just demonstrating the Hill Cipher, we also implemented some of the things we learned with image manipulation and incorporated that into our project too.
## Instructions
1. Pick a message that you want to encode
    - Make sure there are no spaces in this message (remove all spaces)
    - Make sure there are an even amount of characters (el oh el)
2. Open the encode processing sketch
    - Put your desired message in place of the text String in the 7th line
    - You will have a new file in your folder
3. Open the decode processing sketch
    - Run the program
    - It should print the message and the cipherText array after the matrix multiplication
